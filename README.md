# Solve the Daily Sudoku 

This template leverages the new python open-source structure [robo](https://github.com/robocorp/robo), the [libraries](https://github.com/robocorp/robo#libraries) from to same project as well.

In this example robot you have: logging out of the box and controlling your tasks without fiddling with the base Python stuff. The environment contains the most used libraries, so you do not have to start thinking about those right away. 
With `robocorp-browser`, the browser automation uses Playwright without any extra steps. 

ðŸ‘‰ After running the bot, check out the `log.html` under the `output` -folder.
